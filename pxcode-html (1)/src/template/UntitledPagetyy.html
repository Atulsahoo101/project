          Odisha has a coastline of approximately 550 kms, of which 28% is lost to coastal erosion due to repeated severe cyclonic events between 1971 - 2018.
          <br />
          Satabhaya, a remote coastal village of Kendrapara is the foremost victim of these episodic events and is said to be the face of coastal erosion in India.
